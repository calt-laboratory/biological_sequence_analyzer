# biological_sequence_analyzer

Nomen est omen.
This is a basic bioinformatics tool with which one can analyze biological sequences (DNA, RNA) including computations like Nucleotide Frequency, GC-Content, Reverse Sequence Complement, DNA2RNA-Transcription, Codon Bias etc.
Coding style is pythonic as much as possible.
The idea is inspired by the Rosalind coding challenges, in which bioinformatics methods have to be programmed in Python.
